function Stickify(new, root)
    if root.left = new then
        RightRotate(root.value)
        
Analysis:
• To construct a BST from scratch, our function BSTInsert should always ensure it is a ”right
  stick”. Also, if the BST is already a ”right stick”, then running the BSTInsert algorithm (with the
  Stickify function) should always leave the tree as a ”right stick”.
• Therefore, the conditional flow control in our algorithm should detect whether the newly inserted
  node is in the left subtree or in the right subtree.
• If it is in the left subtree, then a rotation right is performed. Otherwise, just let leave it without
  modification.
